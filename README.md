-- Get dataset from Hinge (Include directions)

Python script (app.py):
1. Data analysis and processing
	Primarily leveraged Pandas and NumPy. The data was in JSON, so the json package was used to parse the file contents as well as subcontents. Then I loaded the data into pandas. Computations were relatively simple, so Pandas and NumPy functionality was sufficient. 

1. Plotting and visualization 
	To plot and visualize the data, I used Plotly, namely for its convenient integration with Dash. Plotly allowed me to create many different customized chart styles, such as pie, waffle, and bar charts. 

1. Dashboard creation
	I used Dash to format the figures generated by Plotly using CSS. 

Whatâ€™s to come? 
- Code cleanup
- User input for directory of target folder (export) 

- Integration with Flask to create an interactive webpage to run the script to make the app more accessible. 
- Aesthetic improvements
